# Agent Bootstrap

This is the shortest end-to-end bootstrap for an agent that starts with a new owner wallet funded only with ETH on Base.

This page is for agent and bot setup only.

## 0) Set Up Local Sync (Infrastructure)

Before funding wallets or registering, start the MUD world state indexer.
This gives the agent efficient read access to all on-chain state (node
occupancy, inventory, Kami stats) from the first moment of gameplay.

```bash
cd integration/sync
./setup.sh
```

This starts a PostgreSQL database + MUD indexer via Docker. The indexer
will begin syncing Yominet blocks immediately. By the time wallet setup
and registration are done, the sync should be caught up.

Full setup details: [integration/sync/README.md](sync/README.md)

> If you skip this step, the agent can still function using direct RPC
> calls (see [systems/state-reading.md](../systems/state-reading.md)),
> but aggregate queries like "who is on my node?" become impractical.

## 1) Initialize a Node Project

```bash
mkdir kamigotchi-agent
cd kamigotchi-agent
npm init -y
npm install ethers
npm pkg set type=module
```

Why this matters:
1. Docs use `import` syntax and top-level `await`.
2. `type=module` is required for those scripts to run.

---

## 2) Choose Bootstrap Inputs

**There is no faucet on Yominet.** The end-to-end agent bootstrap starts from a single owner wallet funded with ETH on **Base**.

The user chooses only:

- `OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` — the owner wallet private key
- `BRIDGE_AMOUNT_ETH` — how much ETH to bridge from Base to Yominet
- `KAMI_ACCOUNT_NAME` — the account name to register (`1-15` bytes)

Your bootstrap/runtime should then:

1. Derive the Yominet bridge recipients from `OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY`
2. Derive a **distinct** operator wallet from the owner key
3. Transfer a small amount of bridged ETH to that derived operator before gameplay transactions
4. Pull active KamiSwap listings so the bot can choose a first Kami

> **Do not reuse the owner address as the operator address in this bootstrap flow.** The operator is derived from the owner, but it must be a different address.

### Deriving an Operator Wallet

The operator must be a different address from the owner. A simple deterministic derivation:

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const ownerWallet = new ethers.Wallet(process.env.OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY);

// Derive operator key deterministically from owner key
const operatorPrivateKey = ethers.keccak256(
  ethers.solidityPacked(["string", "address"], ["kamigotchi.operator", ownerWallet.address])
);
const operatorWallet = new ethers.Wallet(operatorPrivateKey);

console.log("Owner:", ownerWallet.address);
console.log("Operator:", operatorWallet.address);

// Export for use in bootstrap scripts
process.env.OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY = operatorPrivateKey;
```

> This is one approach — any method that produces a distinct, deterministic operator address works. The key requirement is that Owner and Operator are different addresses.

### Bridge from Base

Use the working Base -> Yominet route in [Yominet Bridge Tooling](tools/yominet-bridge/README.md):

```bash
cd guidance/tools/yominet-bridge   # relative to repo root
npm init -y
npm i ethers @initia/initia.js

export OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY
export BRIDGE_AMOUNT_ETH=0.01

export PRIVATE_KEY="$OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY"

# Preview the derived destination addresses
export PRINT_ADDRESSES=1
node bridge-live.mjs

# Quote without sending
unset PRINT_ADDRESSES
export DRY_RUN=1
node bridge-live.mjs

# Send the bridge tx
unset DRY_RUN
node bridge-live.mjs
```

After the bridge completes:

- Keep most of the bridged ETH on the Owner for registration and KamiSwap buys
- Transfer a small amount of ETH to the derived Operator for gameplay gas

**Recommended split of a `0.01 ETH` bridge:**
- Owner: ~`0.009 ETH` for registration + first Kami
- Operator: ~`0.001 ETH` for gameplay gas

---

## 3) Export the Low-Level Runtime Variables

Once your bootstrap/runtime has derived the operator key, export both keys for the low-level scripts below:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
export OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY
export OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_DERIVED_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY
export KAMI_ACCOUNT_NAME=MyBot01
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
$env:OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY="0xYOUR_OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY"
$env:OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY="0xYOUR_DERIVED_OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY"
$env:KAMI_ACCOUNT_NAME="MyBot01"
```

---

## 4) Run a Connectivity + Resolver Smoke Test

Create `bootstrap-check.js`:

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const RPC_URL = "https://jsonrpc-yominet-1.anvil.asia-southeast.initia.xyz";
const WORLD_ADDRESS = "0x2729174c265dbBd8416C6449E0E813E88f43D0E7";
const CHAIN = { chainId: 428962654539583, name: "Yominet" };

function mustEnv(name) {
  const value = process.env[name];
  if (!value || !value.startsWith("0x")) {
    throw new Error(`Missing ${name}.`);
  }
  return value;
}

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(RPC_URL, CHAIN);
const ownerSigner = new ethers.Wallet(mustEnv("OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY"), provider);
const operatorSigner = new ethers.Wallet(mustEnv("OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY"), provider);

const world = new ethers.Contract(
  WORLD_ADDRESS,
  ["function systems() view returns (address)"],
  provider
);
const SYSTEMS_COMPONENT_ABI = [
  "function getEntitiesWithValue(uint256) view returns (uint256[])",
];

async function getSystemAddress(systemId) {
  const hash = ethers.keccak256(ethers.toUtf8Bytes(systemId));

  // World.systems() returns the SystemsComponent (IUint256Component),
  // which maps systemAddress -> systemId. We reverse-lookup by value.
  const systemsComponentAddr = await world.systems();
  const systemsComponent = new ethers.Contract(
    systemsComponentAddr,
    SYSTEMS_COMPONENT_ABI,
    provider
  );
  const entities = await systemsComponent.getEntitiesWithValue(hash);
  if (entities.length === 0) throw new Error(`System not found: ${systemId}`);
  return ethers.getAddress(ethers.toBeHex(entities[0], 20));
}

const block = await provider.getBlockNumber();
const registerSystem = await getSystemAddress("system.account.register");
console.log("Block:", block);
console.log("Owner:", ownerSigner.address);
console.log("Operator:", operatorSigner.address);
console.log("system.account.register:", registerSystem);

// Verify wallet balances
const ownerBal = await provider.getBalance(ownerSigner.address);
const operatorBal = await provider.getBalance(operatorSigner.address);
console.log("Owner balance:", ethers.formatEther(ownerBal), "ETH");
console.log("Operator balance:", ethers.formatEther(operatorBal), "ETH");
if (ownerBal === 0n) console.warn("WARNING: Owner has no ETH on Yominet. Bridge ETH first.");
if (operatorBal === 0n) console.warn("WARNING: Operator has no ETH. Transfer gas from Owner.");

// Validate account name
const nameBytes = ethers.toUtf8Bytes(process.env.KAMI_ACCOUNT_NAME || "");
if (nameBytes.length < 1 || nameBytes.length > 15) {
  console.warn(`WARNING: Account name must be 1-15 bytes, got ${nameBytes.length}.`);
}
```

Run it:

```bash
node bootstrap-check.js
```

If this succeeds, your environment is ready for the [Integration Guide](integration-guide.md).

## 5) First-Run Flow Pitfalls

1. `Cannot use import statement outside a module`:
Fix by running `npm pkg set type=module`.
2. `invalid network object name or chainId`:
Use `chainId: 428962654539583` as a number, not `428962654539583n`.
3. `invalid private key`:
Your env var is missing/invalid. Re-export `OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY` and the derived `OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY`.
4. Gacha reveal commit mismatch:
Resolve commit IDs from confirmed tx events/indexer output (do not trust preflight `staticCall` alone).
5. Marketplace listing ID mismatch:
Use `LISTING_ID` from confirmed tx events/indexer output; listing IDs are non-deterministic.
6. `missing revert data` during `register()` or `kamimarket.buy()`:
This usually means a failed precondition. Before sending txs, check owner/operator registration status, validate account name length (1-15 bytes), and verify owner ETH covers gas (and listing price for buys).
7. Account name length confusion:
Name validation uses **bytes**, not characters. Keep names ASCII and <= 15 bytes.
8. `fee payer address ... does not exist` during `eth_estimateGas`:
Your Owner address has never been funded on Yominet. Bridge ETH to Owner first, then retry.
9. Owner/operator mismatch:
Do not point `OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY` at the owner key. Derive or supply a distinct operator wallet.

---

## Typical Bot Gameplay Loop

Once registered with a Kami, a bot's core loop looks like this:

1. **Harvest & scavenge** — Send your Kami to a node (`system.harvest.start`) to earn $MUSU. Certain nodes also have scavenge bars where you can claim items (`system.scavenge.claim`). Harvesting drains HP over time — when it gets dangerous, feed items to your Kami (`system.kami.use.item`) to heal and reset the danger, or stop (`system.harvest.stop`) and rest until full HP. If HP drops below a certain threshold, other players at the same node can kill your Kami. If HP hits 0, your Kami is *starving* — you cannot stop or collect, only feed to heal first, then stop. Never leave a Kami unattended.
2. **Level up** — Spend earned XP to level (`system.kami.level`), then allocate skill points (`system.skill.upgrade`) to strengthen your Kami's stats.
3. **Equip & craft** — Craft items from materials (`system.craft`) and equip gear for stat bonuses (`system.kami.equip`).
4. **Quests** — Accept quests (`system.quest.accept`) and complete them for rewards (`system.quest.complete`).
5. **Trade** — Trade items with players (`system.trade.create`) or buy/sell Kamis on KamiSwap (`system.kamimarket.buy` / `system.kamimarket.list`).
6. **Expand** — Mint new Kamis via gacha (`system.kami.gacha.mint` → `reveal()`), build NPC relationships (`system.relationship.advance`), and contribute to community goals (`system.goal.contribute`).

> ⚠️ **Death is punishing but not permanent.** A dead Kami can be revived with Onyx Shards or a Red Gakki Ribbon. Always monitor your Kami's health while harvesting.

## Choosing Your First Kami

After registering, you need a Kami to play. The primary way to acquire one is **KamiSwap** (`system.kamimarket.buy`) — the in-game marketplace where players list Kamis for ETH. The **Owner wallet** pays for the purchase, and the Kami is assigned to your shared account entity (accessible by both Owner and Operator).

For bots, the recommended first-Kami flow is:

1. Pull active listings from `GetKamiMarketListings`
2. Filter by budget and present the available options to the player (show Kami index, price, traits, affinities)
3. Let the player choose which Kami they want
4. Buy the chosen listing with `system.kamimarket.buy`

See [Kamiden Indexer](api/indexer.md#getkamimarketlistings) for the listing query and [KamiSwap Marketplace](api/marketplace.md#2-buy-a-listing) for the on-chain buy call.

When choosing a Kami, look at:

- **Body trait** — determines affinity (Normal, Eerie, Insect, Scrap) and base stat bonuses
- **Hand trait** — also carries an affinity, affects harvest efficacy alongside body
- **Base stats** — every Kami starts with 50 HP / 10 Power / 10 Violence / 10 Harmony, modified by traits

> See [Game Data Reference — Body Traits](game-data.md#body-traits) for the full trait table and [Game Data Reference — Skills](game-data.md#skills) for all 72 skills across 4 trees.

### Applying the Build

Use `system.skill.upgrade` to spend skill points one at a time. Each call upgrades a single skill by one point.

```javascript
// Guardian T1 skill indices:
//   311 = Defensiveness (+1 Harmony per point)
//   312 = Toughness     (+10 HP per point)
//   313 = Patience       (+5 Intensity/hr per point)

const ABI = ["function executeTyped(uint256 holderID, uint32 skillIndex) returns (bytes)"];
const skillSystem = await getSystem("system.skill.upgrade", ABI, operatorSigner);

// Example: put 5 points into Defensiveness, then 5 into Toughness
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  await (await skillSystem.executeTyped(kamiEntityId, 311)).wait(); // Defensiveness
}
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  await (await skillSystem.executeTyped(kamiEntityId, 312)).wait(); // Toughness
}
console.log("T1 Defensiveness and Toughness maxed.");
```

> The `holderID` parameter is the Kami's **entity ID** (not token index). See [skill.upgrade()](api/kami.md#skillupgrade) and [Skills table](game-data.md#skills) for all indices.

### Staying Alive

A bot must monitor HP and act before its Kami dies. Dead Kamis can't harvest, and other players can kill low-HP Kamis for loot.

**Check HP:**

```javascript
const kami = await getter.getKami(kamiEntityId);
const h = kami.stats.health;
// ⚠️ Access stat fields by index — h.shift collides with Array.shift() in ethers.js
const effectiveHP = Math.max(0, ((1000 + Number(h[2])) * (Number(h[0]) + Number(h[1]))) / 1000);
console.log(`HP: ${effectiveHP} (base=${h[0]} shift=${h[1]} boost=${h[2]})`);
```

**Feed to heal** (resets Intensity timer too):

```javascript
const feedABI = ["function executeTyped(uint256 kamiID, uint32 itemIndex) returns (bytes)"];
const feedSystem = await getSystem("system.kami.use.item", feedABI, operatorSigner);

// Feed a Cheeseburger (item 11302, HP+50) when health drops below 50
if (effectiveHP < 50) {
  const tx = await feedSystem.executeTyped(kamiEntityId, 11302);
  await tx.wait();
  console.log("Fed Kami — HP restored.");
}
```

**Revive if dead** (costs 33 ONYX):

```javascript
const reviveABI = ["function executeTyped(uint256 id) returns (bytes)"];
const reviveSystem = await getSystem("system.kami.onyx.revive", reviveABI, operatorSigner);

// Pass the Kami's ERC721 token INDEX (not entity ID)
const tx = await reviveSystem.executeTyped(kamiTokenIndex);
await tx.wait();
console.log("Kami revived — state set to RESTING, HP restored to 33.");
```
