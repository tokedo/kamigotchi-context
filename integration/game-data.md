> **Total rooms:** 68. Room indices are **not sequential** — gaps exist (e.g., 7, 8, 14, 17, 20–24, 27–28).

### Movement Rules

Rooms are connected by **coordinate adjacency**: two rooms are adjacent if they differ by exactly 1 on a single axis (X or Y) and share the same Z-level. Movement is only possible between adjacent rooms or via **special exits** (listed in the table above), which can connect rooms across Z-levels or non-adjacent coordinates.

**Pathfinding for agents:** Build a graph where edges connect rooms that are coordinate-adjacent (same Z, ΔX or ΔY = 1, other axis unchanged) plus all special exit pairs. Some exits are gated by quest completion or items (e.g., caves require completing MSQ035).

```javascript
// Check if two rooms are adjacent (same Z, differ by 1 on exactly one axis)
function isAdjacent(roomA, roomB) {
  if (roomA.z !== roomB.z) return false;
  const dx = Math.abs(roomA.x - roomB.x);
  const dy = Math.abs(roomA.y - roomB.y);
  return (dx === 1 && dy === 0) || (dx === 0 && dy === 1);
}
```

## Harvest Nodes

Nodes are the harvestable locations within rooms. Each node shares an index with its room. On-chain entity ID: `keccak256("node", nodeIndex)`.

## Equipment

Equipment items (type `"EQUIPMENT"`) can be equipped to Kamis to provide stat bonuses. Each equipment item has a **slot** defined by its `For` field in the item registry. The slot determines where the item is equipped — you do not choose the slot manually.

### Slot Mapping

| `For` Value | Target | Description |
|-------------|--------|-------------|
| `Kami_Pet_Slot` | Kami | Petpet/accessory slot — all current equipment items use this slot |
| `Passport_slot` | Account | Passport staking slot (for NFT passports) |
| `Account_Badge_Slot` | Account | Account badge slot (reserved for future use) |

### How Equipping Works

1. The system reads the item's `For` field from the registry to determine the slot string.
2. If the slot is already occupied, the existing item is **auto-unequipped** (returned to inventory).
3. The item is consumed from inventory, an equipment instance entity is created, and stat bonuses are applied.
4. Each entity has a **default capacity of 1** equipped item total, expandable via `EQUIP_CAPACITY_SHIFT` bonuses.
5. On unequip, bonuses are cleared (using the `ON_UNEQUIP_{SLOT}` end type) and the item returns to inventory.

### Equipment Items

All current equipment items occupy the `Kami_Pet_Slot`. They are obtained from Booster Packs and lootboxes.

## Affinities (Types)

Affinities affect harvest efficacy and liquidation (attack) matchups. There are four affinities:

| Affinity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Normal** | Pure, natural essence — no external influence |
| **Eerie** | Divine or supernatural influence |
| **Insect** | Corruption, defilement, decay |
| **Scrap** | Human-made remnants, material attachments |

### Kami Trait → Affinity Mapping

Each Kami's **body** and **hand** traits carry an affinity. The **face** trait also has an affinity but it is **not used** for harvest efficacy calculations — only body and hand matter for harvesting. Face affinity is used in liquidation (attack) matchups.

> **Source:** Affinities are set per-trait in the trait registry CSV files and stored on-chain in the `AffinityComponent`. The affinity is looked up from the trait's registry entry via `LibKami.getBodyAffinity()` and `LibKami.getHandAffinity()`.

### Harvest Affinity Effectiveness

When a Kami harvests at a node, the **body** and **hand** trait affinities are compared against the node's affinity to determine an efficacy modifier. This is calculated in `LibAffinity.getHarvestEffectiveness()`:

| Kami Trait Affinity | Node Affinity | Effectiveness | Effect |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|--------|
| *(same as node)* | *(any typed)* | **Strong** | Bonus to harvest fertility |
| *(different typed)* | *(different typed)* | **Weak** | Penalty to harvest fertility |
| Normal | *(any)* | **Neutral** | Half of Strong bonus (special case) |
| *(any)* | Normal | **Neutral** | No modifier |
| *(empty)* | *(any)* | **Neutral** | No modifier |

**Key rules:**
- If either the trait affinity or node affinity is empty or `NORMAL`, the result is always **Neutral**
- If both are typed (Eerie/Insect/Scrap) and **match**, the result is **Strong** (bonus)
- If both are typed and **don't match**, the result is **Weak** (penalty)
- `NORMAL` trait affinities receive **half** of the Strong bonus as a special case in `LibHarvest.calcEfficacy()`
- Body affinity has more impact than hand affinity (separate config keys: `KAMI_HARV_EFFICACY_BODY` and `KAMI_HARV_EFFICACY_HAND`)

**Dual-affinity nodes** (e.g., "Eerie-Scrap"): The system picks the most favorable assignment of body/hand to the two node affinities. It prioritizes matching the body trait first since body has higher impact.

### Liquidation (Attack) Affinity Effectiveness

Attack matchups use `LibAffinity.getAttackEffectiveness()` with a rock-paper-scissors triangle:

| Attacker | Defender | Effectiveness |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Eerie | Scrap | **Strong** |
| Eerie | Insect | **Weak** |
| Scrap | Insect | **Strong** |
| Scrap | Eerie | **Weak** |
| Insect | Eerie | **Strong** |
| Insect | Scrap | **Weak** |
| Normal | Normal | **Special** |
| *(any other combo)* | — | **Neutral** |

> The attack affinity triangle: **Eerie → Scrap → Insect → Eerie**. Normal vs Normal is a special case.

## VIP Score System

Kamigotchi integrates with the **Initia VIP** system via `LibVIP` and a standalone `VipScore` contract. VIP scores are tracked per **epoch** (called "stage"), where each stage spans a configurable period (default: 2 weeks). When a player earns VIP-eligible rewards (e.g., harvest bounty), their score is incremented for the current stage. Stages are finalized automatically when the next stage begins. The `VipScore` contract maintains per-address scores per stage, with an allowlist for authorized callers.

---

## Faction Reputation

Factions are named on-chain entities (with metadata: name, description, media URI) that NPCs and potentially players can belong to. Each entity can earn **reputation** with a faction via `LibFaction.incRep()` / `decRep()`. Reputation is stored as a `ScoreEntity` keyed by `(holderID, factionIndex)`, enabling leaderboard queries. Factions are identified by a `uint32` index with entity ID `keccak256("faction", index)`.

---

## GDA Pricing (VRGDA)

`LibGDA` implements a **Variable Rate Gradual Dutch Auction** (discrete VRGDA) pricing model. It calculates the cost of purchasing a quantity of items given a target price, a per-period price decay rate, an emission rate, and the number previously sold. The formula computes a spot price that increases when purchases outpace the target rate and decays when demand is low. This is used for dynamic in-game pricing (e.g., gacha tickets, vendor items). Parameters are configured per auction instance via the `Params` struct (target price, period, decay, rate, quantity).

## Trait Affinities

Each Kami has **body** and **hand** traits, each with an affinity (Normal, Eerie, Insect, or Scrap). Matching your Kami's trait affinities to a harvest node's affinity improves efficacy.

### Body Traits

| Index | Name | Affinity | Rarity |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| 0 | Battery | Scrap | Common |
| 1 | Bee | Insect | Common |
| 2 | Butterfly | Insect | Epic |

| 4 | Cube | Normal | Rare |
| 5 | Ghost | Normal | Common |
| 6 | Drip | Eerie | Common |
| 7 | Lightbulb | Scrap | Common |
| 8 | Working CRT Monitor | Scrap | Epic |
| 9 | Broken CRT Monitor | Scrap | Rare |
| 10 | Octahedron | Normal | Epic |
| 11 | Octopus | Eerie | Common |
| 12 | Orb | Normal | Common |
| 13 | Pumpkin | Eerie | Epic |
| 14 | Tube | Normal | Uncommon |
| 15 | Jellyfish | Eerie | Uncommon |
| 16 | Eyes | Eerie | Rare |

| 2 | Spinning Coins | Normal | Rare |
| 3 | Coins | Normal | Uncommon |
| 4 | Orbs | Normal | Common |
| 5 | Eyeballs | Eerie | Rare |
| 6 | Fan Blades | Scrap | Epic |
| 7 | Beetle | Insect | Common |
| 8 | Mantis | Insect | Epic |
| 9 | Paws | Normal | Common |
| 10 | Plugs | Scrap | Common |
| 11 | Scorpion | Insect | Common |
| 12 | Tentacles | Eerie | Uncommon |
| 13 | Toasters | Scrap | Uncommon |

| 15 | Wrenches | Scrap | Common |
| 16 | Mole Cricket | Insect | Uncommon |
| 17 | Plant | Normal | Uncommon |
| 18 | Guns | Normal | Rare |

### Efficacy

Harvest efficacy depends on body and hand affinity matching the node affinity. The config keys `KAMI_HARV_EFFICACY_BODY` and `KAMI_HARV_EFFICACY_HAND` define multipliers: `base` (neutral), `up` (matching affinity), `down` (mismatched), `special`. Match both body and hand to the node affinity for maximum harvest rate.
