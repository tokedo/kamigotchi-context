# Architecture Overview

Kamigotchi is built on the **MUD Entity Component System (ECS)** framework — a fully on-chain game architecture where all state lives in smart contracts on Yominet, an Initia L2 rollup.

### World

The **World** contract is the root of the entire game. It:

- Maintains a registry of all **Systems** (logic contracts)
- Exposes the `systems()` registry component, which maps `systemAddress -> systemId`
- Resolves system addresses by querying `SystemsComponent.getEntitiesWithValue(keccak256(systemId))` and casting the entity ID to `address`
- Manages access control and ownership
- Emits `ComponentValueSet(uint256 indexed componentId, address indexed component, uint256 indexed entity, bytes data)` and `ComponentValueRemoved(uint256 indexed componentId, address indexed component, uint256 indexed entity)` on every component write/removal — these are the primary events for off-chain indexers to reconstruct game state
- Address: [`0x2729174c265dbBd8416C6449E0E813E88f43D0E7`](https://scan.initia.xyz/yominet-1/address/0x2729174c265dbBd8416C6449E0E813E88f43D0E7)

### Systems

Systems are stateless smart contracts that contain **game logic**. Each system:

- Extends `solecs/System.sol`
- Implements `execute(bytes)` and `executeTyped(...)` entry points
- Is identified by a human-readable **System ID** (e.g., `system.kami.level`)
- Has its address resolved dynamically via the `systems()` component

Kamigotchi has **66 documented player-facing systems** — see [System IDs & ABIs](system-ids.md) for the complete list. The World contract contains additional internal and admin systems not covered here.

### Components

Components are on-chain key-value stores, keyed by **entity ID** (`uint256`). They hold all game state.

**BareComponent vs Component:** `BareComponent` is a basic key-value store (`entityToValue` mapping) with no reverse index — `getEntitiesWithValue()` reverts. `Component` extends it by adding a `valToEntities` reverse mapping (using `EnumerableSet`), enabling lookups like `getEntitiesWithValue(bytes)`. Most game components use the full `Component`; stat components use `BareComponent` since reverse lookups on numeric stats are not needed.

**Access Control (OwnableWritable):** All components inherit `OwnableWritable`, which restricts writes to authorized addresses via the `onlyWriter` modifier. The component owner calls `authorizeWriter(address)` to grant write access to registered systems. The owner and any authorized writer can write; everyone else has read-only access.

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `HealthComponent` | Kami health stats (base, shift, boost, sync) |
| `PowerComponent` | Kami power stats |
| `HarmonyComponent` | Kami harmony stats |
| `ViolenceComponent` | Kami violence stats |
| `IDOwnsInventoryComponent` | Inventory ownership mapping (holder entity ID) |
| `ValueComponent` | Inventory quantity / generic value storage |
| `IndexRoomComponent` | Account room index |
| `ViolenceComponent` | Kami violence stats |
| `StateComponent` | Entity state (RESTING, HARVESTING, DEAD, etc.) |
| `LevelComponent` | Kami level |
| `XPComponent` | Kami experience points |
| `IDOwnsKamiComponent` | Maps account entity to owned Kami entities |
| `IndexItemComponent` | Item index for inventory/equipment entities |
| `NameComponent` | Entity name storage |

### Entities

Every game object is an **entity** — a `uint256` identifier. Entities have no inherent meaning; their type is defined by which components are attached:

- A **Kami** entity has `HealthComponent`, `PowerComponent`, `HarmonyComponent`, `ViolenceComponent`, etc.
- An **Account** entity has `IDOwnsInventoryComponent`, `IndexRoomComponent`, etc.
- A **Trade** entity has trade-specific components

### Entity ID Derivation

Entity IDs are deterministic — derived from known inputs using `keccak256`:

| Entity Type | Derivation | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Account | `uint256(uint160(ownerAddress))` | Owner `0xAbC...` -> entity `0xAbC...` as uint256 |
| Kami | `keccak256(abi.encodePacked("kami.id", kamiIndex))` | Kami #42 -> `keccak256("kami.id", 42)` |
| Harvest | `keccak256(abi.encodePacked("harvest", kamiEntityId))` | Per-Kami harvest state |
| Inventory | `keccak256(abi.encodePacked("inventory.instance", accountId, itemIndex))` | Per-account per-item balance |
| Trade | Non-deterministic — extract from transaction events | Use [Entity Discovery](entity-ids.md) |

See [Entity Discovery](entity-ids.md) for the complete derivation reference and helper code.

## Wallet Architecture

Kamigotchi uses a **dual-wallet model** to balance security with usability:

```
┌──────────────────┐          ┌──────────────────┐
│   Owner Wallet   │  ──────▶ │ Operator Wallet  │
│  (Main wallet)   │ delegates│  (Session key)   │
│                  │          │                  │
│ • Holds NFTs     │          │ • In-game txns   │
│ • Registers acct │          │ • Move, chat     │
│ • ONYX spending  │          │ • Harvest, trade  │
│ • Set operator   │          │ • Privy-managed   │
└──────────────────┘          └──────────────────┘
```

### Owner Wallet

The player's primary wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.). Used for:

- `register()` — Creating a new account
- `set.operator()` — Delegating to an operator wallet
- `set.name()` — Renaming account
- `onyx.rename` and `onyx.respec` (via $ONYX, currently disabled on production)
- ERC721 staking/unstaking
- Trading (create, execute, complete, cancel)
- Gacha ticket purchase and minting
- `kamimarket.buy` — Buying Kami listings on KamiSwap marketplace (sends ETH)

### Operator Wallet

A delegated wallet (typically managed by [Privy](https://privy.io)) for frequent, low-risk transactions:

- Moving between rooms
- Sending chat messages
- Starting/stopping harvests
- Crafting, questing
- Setting profile picture (`set.pfp`)
- Reviving Kami via ONYX (`onyx.revive`)
- `kamimarket.list` — Listing a Kami for sale on the marketplace
- `kamimarket.offer` — Making specific or collection offers (WETH)
- `kamimarket.acceptoffer` — Accepting incoming offers
- `kamimarket.cancel` — Cancelling listings or offers
- All routine gameplay actions

> **Note:** The operator wallet is set during registration and can be updated by the owner wallet via `set.operator()`. This separation means the owner's private key is rarely exposed to transaction signing.

### How the Official Client Creates Wallets

The Kamigotchi game client uses [Privy](https://privy.io) to manage the wallet flow:

1. **Player connects** their external wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.) via Privy → this becomes the **Owner wallet**
2. **Privy auto-creates** an embedded wallet on login (`createOnLogin: 'all-users'`) → this becomes the **Operator wallet**
3. **Registration** calls `register(embeddedWalletAddress, name)` — the player just enters a username

The embedded wallet acts as a session key: it signs routine gameplay transactions without explicit approval popups, while the owner wallet stays secure for privileged operations.

### Programmatic / Bot Integrations

For API integrations and bots, you can bypass Privy and use two private keys directly:

```javascript
function mustEnv(name) {
  const value = process.env[name];
  if (!value || !value.startsWith("0x")) {
    throw new Error(`Missing ${name}. Set it before running this script.`);
  }
  return value;
}

const ownerSigner = new ethers.Wallet(mustEnv("OWNER_PRIVATE_KEY"), provider);
const operatorSigner = new ethers.Wallet(mustEnv("OPERATOR_PRIVATE_KEY"), provider);

// Register: pass the operator address during account creation
const registerSystem = await getSystem("system.account.register", registerABI, ownerSigner);
await registerSystem.executeTyped(operatorSigner.address, "MyBotAccount");
```

This is the approach used throughout the [Integration Guide](guide.md) and Player API documentation.

---

## Reading State

The **GetterSystem** provides view functions for reading game state without gas costs:

```javascript
// Read Kami data
const kamiData = await getterSystem.getKami(kamiEntityId);

// Read Account data
const accountData = await getterSystem.getAccount(accountEntityId);
```

> **Note:** For real-time data, Kamigotchi uses an off-chain indexer. If the indexer lags behind, use the [Echo functions](api/echo.md) to force-emit current state.

---

## System Call Flow

Every player action follows this pattern:

```
1. Client resolves system address from World.systems() component using keccak256(systemId)
2. Player signs tx with Owner or Operator wallet
3. Tx calls the system contract directly at its resolved address
4. System.executeTyped(...) (or execute(bytes)) runs game logic
5. System reads/writes Component state
6. Events emitted → Indexer picks up changes → Client updates
```

> **Note:** The World is a **registry**, not a proxy. It does not route or relay calls — clients resolve system addresses from the World and call them directly.

### Permission Matrix

| Action Category | Owner | Operator | Anyone |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|
| Register account | Yes | - | - |
| Set operator | Yes | - | - |
| Buy Kami (KamiSwap) | Yes | - | - |
| Gacha mint/reroll | Yes | - | - |
| ERC721 stake/unstake | Yes | - | - |
| Trade create/execute | Yes | - | - |
| Move, chat, harvest | - | Yes | - |
| Craft, quest, equip | - | Yes | - |
| List/offer Kami | - | Yes | - |
| Reveal minted Kamis | - | - | Yes |
| Read state (Getter) | - | - | Yes |

### Resolving System Addresses

System contract addresses are **not hardcoded** — they are dynamically resolved from the World contract:

```javascript
import { ethers } from "ethers";

const worldAddress = "0x2729174c265dbBd8416C6449E0E813E88f43D0E7";
const worldAbi = ["function systems() view returns (address)"];
const systemsComponentAbi = [
  "function getEntitiesWithValue(uint256) view returns (uint256[])",
];
const world = new ethers.Contract(worldAddress, worldAbi, provider);
const systemsComponentAddress = await world.systems();
const systemsComponent = new ethers.Contract(
  systemsComponentAddress,
  systemsComponentAbi,
  provider
);

// Resolve a system address
const systemId = ethers.keccak256(ethers.toUtf8Bytes("system.kami.level"));
const entities = await systemsComponent.getEntitiesWithValue(systemId);
if (entities.length === 0) throw new Error("System not found");
const systemAddress = ethers.getAddress(ethers.toBeHex(entities[0], 20));
```

---

## Kami Stat Model

Each Kami entity has four core stat categories, each with four sub-values:

| Stat | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Health** | Durability and survival |
| **Power** | Attack strength |
| **Harmony** | Support and healing |
| **Violence** | Aggressive capabilities |

Each stat has:

| Sub-value | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `base` | Innate stat from Kami species/rarity |
| `shift` | Permanent modifications (leveling, items) |
| `boost` | Temporary buffs/debuffs (percentage multiplier, 3 decimals of precision — baseline 1000 = 100.0%) |
| `sync` | Last synced value (tracks current depleted state for depletable stats like health/stamina) |

**Effective stat formula:** `total = (1000 + boost) * (base + shift) / 1000`. The `boost` field is an `int32` stored with 1e3 precision, so a boost value of `250` means a +25.0% multiplier.

### Kami Lifecycle States

Each Kami has a state tracked by `StateComponent`, defined by the `KamiState` enum:

| State | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `NULL` | 0 | Default / uninitialized |
| `RESTING` | 1 | Idle — available for actions |
| `HARVESTING` | 2 | Currently harvesting resources |
| `DEAD` | 3 | Dead — must be revived before use |
| `EXTERNAL_721` | 4 | Unstaked to external ERC-721 — not in-game |
