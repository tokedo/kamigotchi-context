# Day/Night Cycle — Agent Decision Guide

Phase-gated action timing. Local computation, no RPC needed.

## Cycle Structure

**36-hour cycle** divided into three 12-hour phases:

| Phase | Name | Hours in Cycle | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | DAYLIGHT | 0–11 | Standard activity period |
| 2 | EVENFALL | 12–23 | Transition period |
| 3 | MOONSIDE | 24–35 | Night period |

Repeats every 36 hours (129,600 seconds), offset from Unix epoch.

## Calculation

```javascript
function getDayPhase(timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)) {
  const hour = Math.floor(timestamp / 3600) % 36;
  if (hour < 12) return "DAYLIGHT";   // phase 1
  if (hour < 24) return "EVENFALL";   // phase 2
  return "MOONSIDE";                  // phase 3
}
```

### Phase Timing

To calculate when the next phase starts:

```javascript
function getPhaseEnd(timestamp = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)) {
  const hour = Math.floor(timestamp / 3600) % 36;
  const currentPhaseEnd = hour < 12 ? 12 : hour < 24 ? 24 : 36;
  const hoursLeft = currentPhaseEnd - hour;
  const secondsIntoHour = timestamp % 3600;
  return (hoursLeft * 3600) - secondsIntoHour; // seconds until next phase
}
```

## What Is Phase-Gated

### Quests

Some quest objectives check the current phase:
- `PHASE` objective type with `BOOLEAN` handler
- Example: "complete during MOONSIDE"
- Must be in the correct phase when completing the quest

### Quest Strategy

If a quest requires a specific phase:
1. Check current phase
2. If wrong phase → calculate time until target phase starts
3. Schedule quest completion for the right phase
4. Do other tasks while waiting (harvest, craft, move)

### Other Mechanics

The phase system is designed to gate NPC availability, scavenging yields,
or enemy behavior during specific phases. Check individual quest objectives
for phase requirements.

## Decision Rules

- **Always know the current phase** — compute at the start of each decision tick
- **Plan ahead**: if a phase-gated quest needs MOONSIDE and you're in DAYLIGHT,
  you have 12+ hours. Use that time productively
- **Phase transitions**: no action needed — phases change automatically.
  Just be aware of timing for phase-gated objectives
