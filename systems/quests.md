# Quests & Goals — Agent Decision Guide

Quest prioritization, objective tracking, reward evaluation, and community
goals.

## Quest Types

| Type | Index Range | Giver | Count | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| MAIN | 1–108 | MENU | ~108 | Main story chain (sequential) |
| FACTION (Mina) | 2001–2016 | MINA | ~16 | Mina's faction quests |
| SIDE | 3001–3024+ | Various | ~24+ | Side quests |

Most main quests are **sequential** — each requires completion of the previous
one. Faction quests unlock through specific main quest requirements.

## Quest Lifecycle

```
ACCEPT → complete objectives → COMPLETE → collect rewards
```

### Accept

System: `system.quest.accept`
```
executeTyped(uint32 questIndex)
```

Requirements checked on acceptance:
- Previous quest completed (for sequential chains)
- Item ownership (e.g., "own at least 1 Obol")
- Room location (e.g., "in room 66")
- Community goal completion
- Time gates

On acceptance, **snapshots** are taken for INCREASE/DECREASE objectives
(baseline values recorded).

### Complete

System: `system.quest.complete`
```
executeTyped(uint256 questEntityID)
```

All objectives must be met. Rewards distributed automatically.

### Drop

System: `system.quest.drop`
```
executeTyped(uint256 questEntityID)
```

Abandon an active quest. Can re-accept later (for non-repeatable quests,
behavior may vary).

## Objective Types

### Handler Types

| Handler | How It Works | Snapshot? |
|---|---|---|
| `INCREASE` | Value must increase by N since acceptance | Yes |
| `DECREASE` | Value must decrease by N since acceptance | Yes |
| `CURRENT` | Value must currently meet condition | No |
| `BOOLEAN` | Condition must be true now | No |

### Common Objective Data Types

| Type | Description | Handler |
|---|---|---|
| `HARVEST_TIME` | Time spent harvesting at a node (seconds) | INCREASE |
| `DROPTABLE_ITEM_TOTAL` | Items from scavenging | INCREASE |
| `ITEM_BURN` | Items consumed/given | INCREASE |
| `ITEM_TOTAL` | Items collected | INCREASE |
| `ITEM_SPEND` | Musu spent at shops | INCREASE |
| `MOVE` | Room moves | INCREASE |
| `ROOM` | Currently in specific room | BOOLEAN |
| `SCAV_CLAIM_NODE` | Scavenge claims at a node | INCREASE |
| `CRAFT_ITEM` | Items crafted | INCREASE |
| `KAMI_LEVELS_TOTAL` | Kami levels gained | CURRENT |
| `KAMI_NUM_OWNED` | Kamis currently owned | CURRENT |
| `LIQUIDATE_TOTAL` | Liquidations performed | INCREASE |
| `LISTING_BUY_TOTAL` | NPC shop purchases | INCREASE |
| `TRADE_EXECUTE` | Trades executed | INCREASE |
| `SKILL_POINTS_USE` | Skill points spent | CURRENT |
| `PHASE` | Day/night phase check | BOOLEAN |
| `KAMI_GACHA_REROLL` | Gacha rerolls | INCREASE |

### Snapshot Mechanics

For INCREASE objectives, progress = `currentValue - snapshotValue`.
Activities done **before** accepting the quest don't count. Always accept
quests **before** doing their objectives.

## Rewards

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| Items | Musu, crafting materials, special items |
| Reputation | Faction reputation (2/4/6 points) |
| Flags | Account flags (e.g., `FLAG_CAVES_UNLOCKED`) |

Rewards are distributed automatically on completion.

## Repeatable Quests

Some quests are repeatable with a cooldown:
- After completion, wait for cooldown duration to elapse
- Then re-accept (overwrites previous instance, re-snapshots objectives)
- Good for farming reputation and item rewards

## Completability Check

To check if a quest is completable without spending gas:

```javascript
try {
  await questSystem.executeTyped.staticCall(questEntityId);
  // Quest is completable — all objectives met
} catch {
  // Objectives not yet met
}
```

## Decision Rules

### Quest Prioritization

1. **Main quests** — unlock game content, rooms, features. Highest priority
2. **Faction quests** — build reputation, unlock faction rewards
3. **Side quests** — good rewards but optional

### When to Accept

- Accept quests **before** doing the tracked activity (snapshot-based)
- If a quest requires "harvest X Musu" → accept first, then harvest
- If a quest requires "be in room Y" → accept it when convenient, complete
  when you naturally visit that room

### Quest-Aware Planning

Before starting any activity, check if there's a quest that would track it:
- About to harvest → any harvest-time or scavenge quests available?
- About to move rooms → any room-visit quests?
- About to craft → any craft-item quests?
- About to buy from NPC → any listing-buy quests?

### Completable Quests

Check completable quests every tick using `staticCall`. Complete immediately
to collect rewards and accept the next quest in chain.

## Community Goals

Multi-player contribution targets. Players pool resources toward a shared
objective. When complete, contributors claim tiered rewards.

### Goal Lifecycle

```
CONTRIBUTE (pool resources) → GOAL COMPLETE → CLAIM (per contributor)
```

System: `system.goal.contribute`
```
executeTyped(uint32 goalIndex, uint256 amount)
```

System: `system.goal.claim`
```
executeTyped(uint32 goalIndex)
```

### Reward Tiers

Contributors qualify for tiers based on contribution amount. Higher tiers
include all lower tier rewards. Some rewards are **proportional** to
contribution amount.

### Decision: When to Contribute

- If you have excess resources and the goal reward is valuable
- Consider the proportional reward ratio — more contribution = more reward
- Goals are one-time events; contribute before the target is reached

## Entity IDs

```javascript
// Quest instance
questEntityId = BigInt(ethers.keccak256(ethers.solidityPacked(
  ["string", "uint32", "uint256"],
  ["quest.instance", questIndex, accountId]
)));

// Quest registry
questRegistryId = BigInt(ethers.keccak256(ethers.solidityPacked(
  ["string", "uint32"],
  ["registry.quest", questIndex]
)));
```
